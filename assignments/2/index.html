    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m Roberto Ledesma, a first-generation Computer Science student at San Francisco State University with a passion for technology and innovation. My academic and professional interests include Software Engineering, Web Development, Game Development, and possibly UI/UX Design. My journey with technology began in my childhood, but it was during high school that my passion for computers and programming truly ignited. What started as creating a website for a school project has now evolved into developing personal projects,
         including building a Discord bot.</p>
