## 3. Brief Description of Implementation
- My Assignment 4 consists of a fully functional calculator that solves arithmetic problems and has the same style as the iPhone calculator. The calculator also connects to a portfolio that was with Assignment 3. The styles.css code is from the hybrid.css on Assignment 3. I also copied the base.css from Assignment 3 and also put it into styles.css. I updated the portfolio with my information.

## 4. Challenges Faced
- Some of the challenges I faced was being able to accurately get the same UI as the iPhone calculator. I also was having trouble getting the +/- to function.
